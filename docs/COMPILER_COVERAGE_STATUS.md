# Compiler coverage status

Source fingerprint: `df43c2bf8c93d1021da2e90ec75b737d788492bc6d260aeba60e8b066d426247`

## Current top-level state

- Compiler version: `oracle-ir-v462`
- Runtime IR: `OracleCardIR lowered to canonical CardProgram V2 with a derived SemanticProgram compatibility index`
- CardProgram schema version: `2`
- Commander Oracle objects: `31623`
- Exact fraction: `0.47788`
- Capability records: `459`
- Assured fixed-target compiler nodes/shapes: `926` / `269`

## Top blockers

- The pinned Commander Oracle snapshot is not capability-complete.
- Material compiler residuals remain: `22157`.
- Blocked capability records remain: `4`.
- Configured evidence is incomplete for: `lexing`, `binding`.

Complete corpus, residual, stage, capability, and CardProgram inventories are in the [machine-readable architecture audit](../coverage/architecture-audit.json). The corpus-derived fixed-target grammar shapes and representative identities are in the [Commander Oracle census](../coverage/oracle-coverage-commander.json).
